# Security Policy

### Reporting
We team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/imknown/AndroidLowLevelDetector/security/advisories) tab.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

Please also pay attention to [release notes](https://github.com/imknown/AndroidLowLevelDetector/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md).
